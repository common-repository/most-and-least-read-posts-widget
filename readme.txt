== Description ==
"Most And Least Read Posts Widget" is a free plugin for Wordpress. developed by Giuliano Polverari (WhileTrue.it) to generate lists of the most and least read posts.

The following options are customizable:

* number of posts to show
* exclude posts whose title contains certain words
* show post hits after the title (style customizable via CSS class)
* exclude posts older than XX days

The plugin starts counting hits once activated, storing them in the "custom_total_hits" custom field without the need of external accounts.

The most popular web crawlers (e.g. Googlebot) are recognized and their hits discarded; also Admin hits are discarded.

Archived post hits are shown in a column inside the backend post list.

The plugin is compatible with multi-language WPML plugin, showing most/least read posts for current language.

Optionally, the number of hits can be shown inside the post content, with:

* a custom phrase, e.g. "This post has already been read XX times!"
* a custom position (above the post, below the post, both)
* a custom CSS style

If you want to show the post hits anywhere inside the template loop, you can the PHP function provided, e.g.: 

`echo most_and_least_read_posts_get_hits(get_the_ID());`

= Shortcode =

Also, [most_read_posts] a shortcode is available. Use it like this:

`[most_read_posts type="most" posts_number="5" show_thumbs="false" date_from="2016-01-01" date_to="2016-04-30"]`

Shortcode attributes:

* type: "most" or "least"
* posts_number
* words_excluded
* title_max_chars
* excerpt_max_chars
* show_thumbs: "true" or "false"
* add_line_break_before_thumbs: "true" or "false"
*	show_hits: "true" or "false"
*	show_hits_text (default: "views")
* days_ago
* date_from and date_to: if set, overwrite the "days_ago" attribute (format: YYYY-MM-DD)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I get an error message that says "no results available" =
The plugin starts collecting hits once installed, so there are "no results available" for a short time, until the first data is stored. 
It's better to show the widget some hours (or days) after having installed it.

= The same post shows up multiple times =
This uncommon issue can be caused by duplicated custom fields in some posts. 
To solve it, inspect the post custom fields and delete unnecessary duplicates of the "custom_total_hits" field. 

= Can I customize the thumbs? =
Yes, you can do it editing the "mlrp_ul" class in your template style.css file.
E.g. 50x50 pixels images, floating on the right:
.mlrp_ul img { width: 50px; height: 50px; float: right; }
